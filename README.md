# Secret Calculator
Astrazeneca Neurodiversity Hackathon 
Challenge #2

### Inspiration

I wasnâ€™t aware that people with dyscalculia struggle with manipulating simple numbers mentally. Here's a solution for it :)


### What It Does

Imagine you're talking to someone, there's a need to do some simple calculations and you feel it would be embarrassing to pull out your phone calculator, or your fingers. Simply start the webiste by clicking anywhere and it will start recording. This calculator extracts the numbers from conversation and say the solution for you.  It disconnects itself when no sound is recorded.

### Built With

Web Speech API, Javascript, HTML/CSS.

### Further Improvements / What's Next

Would be cool to have an app and improve speech recognition - add intelligence to it?
